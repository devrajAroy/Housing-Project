# Housing Project
## 1 Introduction

 This report shows our investigations into housing using the data given to us, from which we
 were able to make our conclusions. The information includes demographic nature, type price
 and prices relevant to housing over time. When dealing with the raw data, we have used the
 Spyder software, for both visualisation and analysis.
 Among our goals is to provide an empirical basis for any patterns or trends we see in the

 character of housing. Ultimately, this report will offer a broad view of the field and its theory
 alongside applications. The simulations detailed within will inform firms on evidence-based
 approaches to best practice.
 Aside from the results of our investigation and company research, we will offer a break
down of the people and their roles in this project. We will look to employ the same sort of
 mathematical rigor and clarity in the presentation of our method as we do in our main body.

Across the regions, home ownership seemed fairly consistent from 1996 to 2006. The South
 East and South West maintained steady home ownership rates throughout this time. This
 could be attributed to a relatively stable housing market and the fact that these regions have
 a stronger economy compared to the northern parts of the UK. However, London was already
 experiencing a decline in home ownership, exhibiting the lowest owner-occupancy rates out
 of all regions. This is likely due to the high property prices in London resulting from high
 demand and the fact that more people in London tend to rent rather than own a property
 Pettinger (2022). After 2006, there was a significant drop in home ownership, which could
 be attributed to the global financial crisis of 2007-2008 and its aftermath Helmores (2024).
 The crisis led to stricter mortgage lending standards and a decrease in available credit Smith
 (2008). This made it increasingly difficult for people to secure home loans. Additionally, the
 crash of the housing market led to a decline in property values in many regions, potentially
 putting some households into negative equity and making it difficult for them to sell or buy
 homes. When analysing the data by country, England and Wales show a similar pattern to
 the trend shown by the regions. What was notable was the stark increase in home ownership
 in Northern Ireland and Scotland between 1996 and 2006. One of the reasons for this was
 the implementation of targeted government housing initiatives for underprivileged people, such
 as the Northern Ireland Co-ownership Housing Scheme, developed in 1978, and the Scottish
 Governmentâ€™s Shared Equity Scheme, developed in 1983.

 By comparing the patterns of renting over time by region and country in the UK, we can see
 that private renting has gradually increased in all regions and countries, whereas social renting
 has been on a steady decline between 1996 and 2016. London stands out as the region with the
 highest proportion of households privately renting. This relates back to how generally more
 people in London can only afford to rent rather than purchase a property Pettinger (2022). We
 mayattribute the decline in social renting across all regions and countries to government policies
 over the years which have aimed to implement and promote home ownership initiatives, thereby
 increasing the supply of affordable housing through the private sector rather than relying on
 social housing.
