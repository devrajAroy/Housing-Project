# Housing Project
# 1 Introduction

 This report shows our investigations into housing using the data given to us, from which we
 were able to make our conclusions. The information includes demographic nature, type price
 and prices relevant to housing over time. When dealing with the raw data, we have used the
 Spyder software, for both visualisation and analysis.
 Among our goals is to provide an empirical basis for any patterns or trends we see in the

 character of housing. Ultimately, this report will offer a broad view of the field and its theory
 alongside applications. The simulations detailed within will inform firms on evidence-based
 approaches to best practice.
 Aside from the results of our investigation and company research, we will offer a break
down of the people and their roles in this project. We will look to employ the same sort of
 mathematical rigor and clarity in the presentation of our method as we do in our main body.
